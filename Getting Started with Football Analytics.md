# Getting Started: Football Data Analytics with Python
The aim of this short document is to provide some guidance and advice on getting started with football data analytics using Python.

As with starting most new things, it can be a little overwhelming. There are a huge number of relevant resources out there already, but I thought it worth providing an overview of the path that I took into football data analytics.

## Roadmap
One of the key pieces of advice I have; don't try and run before you can walk. Whilst it is seriously tempting to immerse yourself in football data immediately, it's critical that you develop a thorough understanding of the Python programming language before-hand. In taking the time to learn the fundamentals of Python coding as part of wider analytics skill-set, you will best position yourself to develop as a football data analyst.

I have put together a basic roadmap that identifies a logical sequence of activities that you can undertake to get started with Football Data Analytics. I will expand on each activity in the following sections.
