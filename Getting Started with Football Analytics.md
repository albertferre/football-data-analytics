# Getting Started: Football Data Analytics with Python
The aim of this short document is to provide some guidance and advice on getting started with football data analytics using Python.

As with starting most new things, it can be a little overwhelming. There are a huge number of relevant resources out there already, but I thought it worth providing an overview of the path that I took into football data analytics.

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of tools, projects and resources that aim to support the generation of meaningful insight from football data. Python is used for extraction, processing, analysis and visualisation of event data, aggregated team data, market value data and more. The repository is broken down into mutliple projects and sub-projects, each of which aims to either perform a specific analysis, generate some specific insight, or introduce some level of automation to football data analytics. Using the contents of this repository, a number of novel & informative visuals and text threads have been created and shared with the football data analytics community via Twitter [(@_JKDS_)](https://twitter.com/_JKDS_).
